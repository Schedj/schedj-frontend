# SCHEDJ Frontend
A mobile application for students to access and manage scheduling and student accounts. Utilizes React Native to cross-platform deploy. Connects to the SCHEDJ backend for API and data.

## Installation
We use the Expo SDK currently. Make sure you have the latest version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and then:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
git clone https://github.com/Schedj/schedj-frontend
cd schedj-frontend
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the Expo server. The docs for Expo can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/).
