# How to Contribute

1. Create a fork of the repository. This will add a copy of the repo to your user account. 
2. Create a branch off of master in your repository, titled appropriately with the name of the feature/fix you are trying to implement. 
3. Once it has been coded and added to your repo, attempt a merge in your repo and test that everything works. Then, create an upstream pull request to the original repository for administrators to test and approve.
