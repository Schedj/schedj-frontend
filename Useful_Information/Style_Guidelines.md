# Schedj Style Guidelines

## Content Principles
All content contributed should follow the following principles:

* **Approachability:** Ensure contributions are intelligently commented and/or organized.
* **Brevity:** Less is sometimes more, try to minimize wasteful content.
* **Clarity:** Allows contributers to get up to speed minimum effort on their part.

These principles will allow for community members the greatest ease of use for our program into the future.
